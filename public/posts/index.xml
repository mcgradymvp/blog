      <description>In Bayesian statistics, we treat the unknown parameter $\theta$ as a random variable, and estimate $\theta$ by a posterior distribution, which is proportional to the product of prior and likelihood. When conjugate prior is applied, the analytical form of posterior can be derived since it has the same form as prior. In some situations, we are able to perform a numerical integration of normalising constant. However, in most cases, the analytical and numerical results can be hardly obtained, especially in high-dimensional cases.</description>
